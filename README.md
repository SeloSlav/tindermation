## Description
Tindermation is an automation script for Android devices that swipes right on every single encounter. This project was forked from <a href="https://github.com/feelobot">feelobot</a> and updated for use in the more recent Tinder installations. I've simplified the script just to get it running so it doesn't send pick up lines or anything fancy yet, but it is operable with some configuration.

## Setup Instructions

If you are a Windows user, I would begin by installing <a href="https://www.google.cz/search?q=cygwin+latest+installation&rlz=1C1CHBD_enCZ733CZ733&oq=cygwin+latest+installation&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2824j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Cygwin</a>. This will allow you to quickly download the required dependencies to run this script. Make sure to include ``curl``, ``rvm``, ``brew``, ``node``, ``ant``, ``mvn`` and ``npm`` with your initial installation.

Install the latest stable release of Ruby.
```
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
rvm install ruby
```

Make sure RVM is using the correct Ruby by default
```
rvm list
rvm --default use 2.1.1
```

If you have an old ruby/rvm, you can upgrade with
```
rvm get head
rvm autolibs homebrew
rvm install ruby
```

Check that it’s installed properly by printing the ruby version.
```
ruby --version
```

Update RubyGems and Bundler.
```
gem update --system
gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri bundler
gem update
gem cleanup
```

Check that RubyGems is >= 2.1.5
```
gem --version
```

Install appium_console gem.
```
gem uninstall -aIx appium_lib
gem uninstall -aIx appium_console
gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri appium_console
```

Install flaky gem.
```
gem uninstall -aIx flaky
gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri flaky
```

Install brew
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

Install nodejs using brew.
```
brew update
brew upgrade node
brew install node
```

Node should be v6 or better. Don’t use the big green install button on nodejs.org or all npm commands will require sudo.
```
node --version
npm --version
```

Install ant if it’s not already installed.
Install maven 3.1.1 or better if it’s not already installed. Old maven will not work.
```
ant -version
mvn -version
```

Clone appium
```
git clone git://github.com/appium/appium.git
```

Run npm install. When running npm install, make sure to be on Xcode 9+ (if on MacOS)
```
cd appium
npm install
```

If you see config errors, try cleaning git. ``git clean -dfx; git reset --hard``

Authorize for testing. If you’re only testing Android, this can be skipped.
```
npm install -g authorize-ios
authorize-ios
```

Start appium (from the appium directory)
```
node .
```

or (from any directory)

```
appium &
```

## Download the Tinder APK

Download the latest Tinder APK: http://www.androidapksfree.com/apk/tinder-apk-latest-version-download-for-android/

<hr>

<a name="clone"></a>
## Clone Tindermation

Download the actual Tindermation script from this repository with the following command ``git clone https://github.com/santafebound/tindermation.git``

<hr>

<a name="configure"></a>
## Configure the Script

If you are running this script from a connected Android device then pay attention to lines 21-30:

```ruby
capabilities = {
    'appium-version'=> '1.6.4',
    'platformName'=> 'Android',
    'platformVersion'=> '6.0',
    'deviceName'=> '10.0.0.2:5555',
    'device' => 'android',
    'app' => 'C:/tindermation-apk/tinder.apk',
    'app-package' => 'com.tinder',
    'app-activity' => 'com.tinder.activities.ActivitySplashLoading_'
  }
```

It is here that you will configure your ``platformVersion``, i.e. 6.0, the file path to your APK, under ``app``, i.e. C:/tindermation-apk/tinder.apk, or wherever you have installed it on your computer, and your ``appium-version``, i.e. 1.6.4.

## Run the Script

Navigate to ``C:\Users\santafebound\Documents\tindermation\node_modules\.bin`` and run the following Ruby commands:

```ruby
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Double-check that your appium server is running with ``appium &``. Finally, from the root directory at ``C:\Users\santafebound\Documents\tindermation`` run:

```ruby
ruby tindermation.rb
```

## Future Development
Getting the script to run properly on every device will be require some refactoring because as for now I'm simply selecting the X,Y coordinates that correspond to certain UI elements on my own device. I will have to download Appium Inspector or UI Automator Viewer to determine the actual element identifiers. Anway, feel free to make a Pull Request if you would like to contribute and improve upon the script! It would also be nice to Dockerize everything because there are many dependencies and this could be annoying for non-developers. I mean, just take look at the Setup Instructions above. Otherwise, enjoy!
