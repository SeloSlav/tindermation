## Description
Tindermation is an automation script that swipes right on every single encounter. It also sends corny pick-up lines for each match. This project was forked from @freelobot and updated for use in the latest Tinder installations.

## Example Output
```
Looking for girls to match...

Hey..somebody farted. Let's get out of here.
Is your last name Gillete cause your the best a man can get.
So what haven't you been told tonight?
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes..
You must be a sargeant, because you have my private standing in attention.
I've just moved you to the top of my 'to do' list.
Go up to a girl, ask her: "Do you know what winks and screws like a tiger?" [No] Then wink..
The only reason I would kick you out of bed would be to fuck you on the floor.

NO MORE MATCHES :(

## Setup Instructions

I would begin by installing <a href="https://www.google.cz/search?q=cygwin+latest+installation&rlz=1C1CHBD_enCZ733CZ733&oq=cygwin+latest+installation&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2824j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Cygwin</a> if you are a Windows user in order to quickly download the required dependencies. Make sure to include ``curl`` in your installation.

Install the latest stable release of Ruby.
```
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
rvm install ruby
```

Make sure RVM is using the correct Ruby by default
```
rvm list
rvm --default use 2.1.1
```

If you have an old ruby/rvm, you can upgrade with
```
rvm get head
rvm autolibs homebrew
rvm install ruby
```

Check that it’s installed properly by printing the ruby version.
```
ruby --version
```

Update RubyGems and Bundler.
```
gem update --system
gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri bundler
gem update
gem cleanup
```

Check that RubyGems is >= 2.1.5
```
gem --version
```

Install appium_console gem.
```
gem uninstall -aIx appium_lib
gem uninstall -aIx appium_console
gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri appium_console
```

Install flaky gem.
```
gem uninstall -aIx flaky
gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri flaky
```

Install brew
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

Install nodejs using brew.
```
brew update
brew upgrade node
brew install node
```

Node should be v6 or better. Don’t use the big green install button on nodejs.org or all npm commands will require sudo.
```
node --version
npm --version
```

Install ant if it’s not already installed.
Install maven 3.1.1 or better if it’s not already installed. Old maven will not work.
```
ant -version
mvn -version
```

Clone appium
```
git clone git://github.com/appium/appium.git
```

Run npm install. When running npm install, make sure to be on Xcode 9+ (if on MacOS)
```
cd appium
npm install
```

If you see config errors, try cleaning git. ``git clean -dfx; git reset --hard``

Authorize for testing. If you’re only testing Android, this can be skipped.
```
npm install -g authorize-ios
authorize-ios
```

Start appium
```
node .
```
